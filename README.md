# Simple Address Validator

This nodejs console app takes a CSV formatted string of addresses and validates them against
the [byteplant address validator](https://www.address-validator.net).

## Run the code

1. `yarn` or `npm i` to install
2. Set the `API_KEY` in `env.example.js` and change the file name to `env.js`
3. Run it:
    - `cat ./file.csv | node .` OR
    - `node . ./file.csv`

## Testing

Run `yarn test` to run the Mocha test suite.

## Design

I divided the code up as I would if I were beginning to develop something more robust.
- `classes` for data models
- `services` for API handlers and context-independent business logic
- `utils` for simple, atomic methods that are likely to be used repeatedly
- `index.js` for the main program

I would have liked to atomize more of the `index.js` functionality, but things were starting
to get out of hand. The nesting and recursion, along with the async-iterator pattern in the csv parse
added some layers of complexity that I would need more time to abstract out.

### Features

- The app can accept a `.txt` or `.csv` file, as long as it is in the prescibed format:
    ```
    Street Address, City, Postal Code
    123 e Maine Street, Columbus, 43215
    1 Empora St, Title, 11111
    ```

- It can also accept a `\n`-separated list of `.txt` or `.csv` files. This will cause each
file to be processed asynchronously.
- The `API_KEY` can be changed at runtime by passing the`--key` or `-k` flag
- There is a timeout set in milliseconds on the check for data on `stdin`. It can be changed in the `env.js` file,
or at runtime by passing the `--timeout` or `-t` flag.

### Classes

The `AddressDTO` and `ValidationResponse` models are designed to allow for changes in the data structures
that feed them, the CSV data and API responses, respectively. 

Differently structured CSV data will work as long as it includes the three required fields: 'Street Address', 
'City', and 'Postal Code'. If any of those fields are named differently in the data, an update to the constructor
can account for that without changing any of the logic.

`ValidationResponse` similarly allows for any changes in the API response structure to be handled in the
constructor without modifying any of the application logic.

### Services

I chose to create the `environment` service so that the API key and `stdin` timeout could be overridden by
runtime arguments. 

The `address-validator` service is intended to be a place for any validation logic that is independent from the presentation
and other business logic. That could include addition of other address-validator.net APIs, data transforms, etc.

### Notes

- I use Windows, so `cat` created some issues with PowerShell. I have tested this using `type`, instead
  - `type ./test/test-addresses.csv | node .`
- there are a few test files available:
    ```
      ðŸ“¦test
      â”£ ðŸ“œempty.csv
      â”£ ðŸ“œtest-addresses.csv // four addresses, 'SUSPECT' and 'INVALID' statuses
      â”£ ðŸ“œtest-addresses-2.csv // same as above, repeated 154x (616 records)
      â”— ðŸ“œtest-list.txt // list of multiple files
    ```
- If the last line of data ends in `.txt` or `.csv` it will be treated as a list of files. On
recursion only lines pointing to valid files will be evaluated.
